# Quick Fix for Current Issues

## Problem Analysis
From your console output, I can see:
1. ✅ Server is running (health check passed)
2. ✅ Database is connected
3. ❌ Google Auth failing to initialize
4. ❌ Characters loading from localStorage instead of database

## Immediate Fix

### 1. Refresh Your Browser
- **Hard refresh**: Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- This will reload all JavaScript files with the latest changes

### 2. Check Console Again
After refresh, you should see:
```
CharacterImporter initialized
Loading characters...
Auth manager available: true
User authenticated: true
Token available: true
Database response status: 200
Loaded characters from database: X
```

### 3. If Still Not Working

**Step 1: Clear Browser Data**
```javascript
// Open browser console (F12) and run:
localStorage.clear();
location.reload();
```

**Step 2: Check Authentication**
```javascript
// In console, check:
console.log('Auth status:', window.authManager.isUserAuthenticated());
console.log('Token:', window.authManager.getToken());
```

**Step 3: Manual Character Refresh**
```javascript
// In console, run:
window.characterCardManager.refreshCharacters();
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Login**: Characters load from database
2. **Logout**: Characters disappear completely
3. **Login again**: Characters reappear from database
4. **Different computer**: Same characters appear

## If Google Auth Still Fails

The Google Auth error is not critical - you can still use email login/register. The important part is that characters should sync between devices using the database.

## Test Steps

1. **Computer 1:**
   - Login with email
   - Import a character
   - Check console for "Loaded characters from database"

2. **Computer 2:**
   - Login with same email
   - Click "Refresh" button
   - Character should appear

Let me know what you see in the console after refreshing!
